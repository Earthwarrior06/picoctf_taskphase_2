How you approached the challenge:

## step 1
First I converted the given encryptor into an equivalent code that doesnt need to import any modules.
```bash
chars="og_text"
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

print(out)
```

## step 2
Next thinking of the encryptor as a function I tried to take its "inverse" by looking at the code backwards (helped by tracing outputs)

Also used %40 in line 9 even though there are 42 characters since "\n and \" " are escape sequences and considered a single character in python
```
chars="DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

output=""
prev=0
for i in chars:
    cur_prev=lookup2.index(i)
    output+= lookup1[(cur_prev+prev)%40]
    prev= cur_prev+prev

print(output)

```
### Output
```bash
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1

```
## step 3
Using this code (adding brackets to print aswell) I once again turned it into its equivalent.

Next I input the above output into the code (due to the comment "#selfinput")

```bash
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = '''#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1

'''
'''from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line'''
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print (chars[i]) #prints
        b += 1 / 1

```
### Output
```bash
a
d
l
i
b
s
```

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. first concept
2. second concept
3. etc.

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- I had initially tried to make the inverse of the programme i was confused on how to make an inverse for the mod "%" operator.
  Later I realised that it just existed to as a limit the checking to the boundaries of lookup1 and lookup2
- For step 3 i had initially set the input as my original encrypted text having not read "#selfinput"
